Resident 1: Whoa! You scared me! You look really strange!
Player: ……
Resident 1: Ah, sorry… I didn’t mean you’re ugly, hehe. I’ve just never seen someone like you before.
Player: ……Where is this place?
Resident 1: Huh? You don’t know where this is!
Player: I forgot.
Resident 1: Then your memory’s really bad. This place is called I-8010.
Player: Huh? That’s such a weird name…
Resident 1: Hey! You’re the weird one calling us weird!
Player: …
Resident 1: Where are you heading?
Player: Hmm… I’ll go up first.
Resident 1: Huh? Going up?
Resident 1: It’s not safe up there. You never know what dangers lurk in the dark.
Player: …
Resident 1: Looks like you’re determined to go. Wait a sec, I’ll get you something.
Resident 1: Here, take this stick for self-defense! You’ll feel a bit braver with it.
Player: ……Thank you (*°▽°)
Resident 1: Wow! I can tell you’re trying to smile! But that’s kind of scary.
Player: ……
Resident 1: Hahaha! I’m just kidding! You’re really unique!
Resident 1: Don’t mention it! Stay safe out there!
Resident 1: Oh, and be careful of the guards! They hate anything that looks… out of place.
