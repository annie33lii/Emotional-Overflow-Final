Thief: Ha! You clearly aren’t from around here!
Player: ……
Thief: Hahaha, don’t worry, I’m not like those stiff guards — I don’t hate outsiders.
Player: Guards?
Thief: Yeah, those blockheads patrolling near the passageways. They’re always hunting for foreigners.
Player: Why?
Thief: Who knows! I don’t like talking to them… but I do like stealing a few things from them.
Player: Steal… things?
Thief: Hey! What’s with that look?! I’m not your average petty thief!
Player: o_o ....
Thief: Hey, this skill is essential for adventurers in this world!
Player: Huh? Why’s that?
Thief: You’ll only understand once you learn it!
Player: [Stealing]… What could that even be used for?
Thief: It’s not the kind of stealing you’re thinking of!
Thief: You can’t steal inorganic stuff — no money, no objects, none of that works!
Player: Eh? Then what can you steal?
Thief: Hehe, now you’re curious, huh?
Player: ……
Thief: You seem like someone fated to meet me, so I’ll give you a little hint.
Thief: (whispering) You can steal organic matter — anything with signs of life. ( •̀ ^ •́ )✧
Player: !
Thief: Impressive, huh?
Player: How can I learn that?
Thief: Heh, I don’t teach people that easily!
Thief: But… my next stop is II-8010. If you can find me there, that means you’ve got some skill!
Thief: And for a skilled student… I never say no. O(∩_∩)O
