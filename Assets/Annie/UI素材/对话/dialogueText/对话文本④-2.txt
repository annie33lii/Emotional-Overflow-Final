Resident 2: Oh! What happened to your face? You look so strange!
Player: ……
Resident 2: Looking like that, you won’t make any friends — people might even think you’re dangerous!
Resident 2: But I know a rather odd doctor. Last time my nose got crooked, they fixed it for me. I heard they’ve got some kind of magical potion too — you should go see them.
Player: How can I find them?
Resident 2: Well, just go past that long stretch of dark fog up ahead — you’ll find them there.
Player: …Thank you.
Resident 2: Good luck!
