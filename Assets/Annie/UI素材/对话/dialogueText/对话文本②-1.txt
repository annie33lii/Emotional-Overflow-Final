Cosmetic Shop Owner: Welcome to my little shop~ A guest who braved the long darkness to visit me~

Cosmetic Shop Owner: You’re quite the quiet one, aren’t you~
Cosmetic Shop Owner: Most people come here because someone in town told them about me. So, tell me, my special guest — what are you looking for?
Player: I heard you have potions with… magical effects.
Cosmetic Shop Owner: Oh! I see! Indeed, I do have such things — but they don’t come for free.
Player: What kind of magical effects? And what do you want in return?
Cosmetic Shop Owner: Ahhh! What an impatient customer you are.
Cosmetic Shop Owner: Why don’t you take a look at the shop’s descriptions yourself? Here, have a look.
